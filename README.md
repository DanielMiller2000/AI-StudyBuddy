## **About the Project**

**AI-Powered Virtual Study Buddy** is an intelligent assistant designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners simplify their study routines. It leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing and transformer architectures to automate time-consuming tasks like summarizing long texts, generating flashcards, and answering questions with context-aware accuracy.

The system utilizes advanced NLP techniques including:
- **BERT-based Transformers** for semantic understanding and content analysis
- **Attention Mechanisms** for identifying key concepts and relationships
- **Extractive and Abstractive Summarization** using encoder-decoder architectures
- **Probabilistic Keyword Extraction** with domain-specific vocabulary boosting
- **Semantic Similarity Analysis** using word embeddings and contextual representations

Unlike generic AI tools, **Study Buddy** is designed specifically for learning, implementing specialized NLP pipelines:
- Text preprocessing with custom tokenization and cleaning
- TF-IDF and statistical analysis for content importance
- Multi-head attention for context-aware summarization
- Bidirectional encoding for comprehensive text understanding
- Fine-tuned transformer models for educational content
